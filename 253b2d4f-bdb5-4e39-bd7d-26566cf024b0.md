An accelerator batch is a group of companies included in a startup accelerator's program over a described period of time. The batches, or cohorts, of companies may be determined based on a time of year (for example, Summer and Winter batches) or on themes or industries.  The accelerator batch should not be confused with the accelerator (ie, the program that organizes and oversees the batches) itself.
