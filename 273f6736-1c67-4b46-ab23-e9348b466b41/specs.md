## Entity naming convention:

- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should reflect the naming commonly used in reliable government and/or legal sources in the jurisdiction of the law.
- Generally the shorter name of a law is preferred if both are commonly used.  Longer names, as well as other widely used variations of the firmâ€™s name, and widely used acronyms for the legislation should be added to `Also Known As`.
- Name should ideally include a year for disambiguation.  ex. *Securities Exchange Act of 1934*.
- If two acts are passed in the same year with the same name, include jurisdiction.
- Name should be in English.  If the official name of the study is in another language, it should be added to the `Official Name` field.
