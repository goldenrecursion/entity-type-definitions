## Entity naming convention:

- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should match that of the name of the port as it appears on an official website or other source owned or controlled by the port.  If no official sources exist, styling should follow that of a trusted source such as a government agency regulating the port.
- For ports with “Port of” in the name, “of” should be lowercase.  Ex. *Port of Shanghai*, not *Port Of Shanghai*.
- Name should be the current name of the port.  If the name has changed, past names should be added to `Previous Name`.
- Name should be in English.  If the official name is in another language, it should be added to the `Official Name` field, and other widely used variations may be added to `Also Known As`. Ex. `Name`: *Port of Bahia Blanca*, `Official Name`: *Puerto Bahia Blanca.*
- An acronym should only be used as the name if it is the current official name the port.
- Articles (a, the) and punctuation (&) should be included if part of the port’s official name.
