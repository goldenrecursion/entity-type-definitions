Ports are any place where ships dock on the coast of an ocean, river, or lake to unload or load any cargo or passengers aboard. Often a port will be categorized by its purpose, for example, a cargo port or a military port. While ports can be defined as any harbor or area that is able to provide shelter to numerous boats and vessels, in the modern context most ports are well-equipped specialized areas with fixtures to facilitate the regular dealings with cargo. Ports are a distinct entity from the geographic place where they are located, ie, Port of Long Beach (Is a: Port), Long Beach (Is a: Location).  Ports should not be confused with the Port Authority that manages them.
