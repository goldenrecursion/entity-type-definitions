## Entity naming convention:

- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should match that of the name currently in wide use by reliable sources (for example, the CIA World Factbook).
- Name should be in English.  If the official location name is in another language, it should be added to the *Official Name* field, and other widely used name variations may be added to `Also Known As`.
- If a country was previously known by a different name, it should be added to `Previous Name`. Ex. `Name`: *Mumbai*, `Previous Name`: *Bombay*.
- Any further disambiguating locations should be added after the location name, in growing geographic hierarchy, generally following: district → city or town or division or rural area → county or region → country → continental section → continent.  Ex. *Berkeley, California*.
- If further disambiguation is needed between two widely known locations, a location identifier may be added in parentheses after the name.  Ex. *Georgia (country)* and *Georgia (U.S. state).*
