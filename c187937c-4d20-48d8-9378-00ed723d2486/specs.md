## Entity naming convention:

- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should match that of the name of the product on the official website or other page controlled by the product’s parent company or organization.
- Product name should singular, not plural. Ex. *iPhone*, not *iPhones.*
- Name should be the current name of the product.  If the product name has changed, past names should be added to `Previous Name`.
- Name should be in English.  If the official name is in another language, it should be added to the *Official Name* field, and other widely used variations may be added to `Also Known As`.
- An acronym should only be used as the name if it is the current official name of a product.
- Articles (a, the) should be included if part of the product’s official name.
- For names shared by multiple product entities, add a brief 1-3 word industry, field, or other descriptor in parentheses for disambiguation.
