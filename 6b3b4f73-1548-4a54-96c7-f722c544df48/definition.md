A patent is a type of intellectual property (IP) protection that grants an exclusive right to make, use, import, or sell an invention.Â  Patents are granted by sovereign governments and provide inventors a limited period of time to benefit from newly created products or processes while preventing others from copying the invention without permission from the inventor.
