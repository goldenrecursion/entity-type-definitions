An initial public offering (IPO) refers to the process of offering shares of a private companyÂ to the public in a new stock issuance for the first time, allowing the company to raise equity capital from public investors. An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry fund raising equivalent of an IPO. Debt funding occurs when a firm raises money for capital without offering equity.
