## Entity naming convention:

- When possible, the funding round name should follow the format: [`Funded Company`] [`Funding Type`], [`Date Announced`], matching the structured data fields on the funding round entity fields. Ex. *NEAR Protocol Series B round, January 13, 2022*
- If `Funding Type` data does not exist, the funding round name should follow the format: [`Funded Company`] funding round, [`Date Announced`] Ex. *Vislink Technologies, Inc. funding round, April 2020*
- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling of [`Funded Company`] in the funding round entity name should match with the name as it appears in the Funded Company field.
