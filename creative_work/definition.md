A creative work is a manifestation or exemplification of a creative endeavor. Creative works come in many forms, such as writing (poetry, fiction and nonfiction, manuscripts and other literary forms), film and video, multimedia, music, painting, and the performing arts. A creative work is commonly used in the context of copyright. A creative work should not be confused with the medium in which is produced or with the person or group who created the creative work. A creative work may be a remake or reimagining of another creative work.
