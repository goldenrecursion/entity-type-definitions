## Entity naming convention:

- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should match that of the name currently in wide use by reliable sources (for example, the CIA World Factbook).
- Name should be in English.  If the official country name is in another language, it should be added to the *Official Name* field, and other widely used variations may be added to `Also Known As`.
- If a country was previously known by a different name, it should be added to `Previous Name`. Ex. `Name:` *Thailand*, `Previous Name`: *Siam*.
