A product is an object or system made available for consumer use.  Common categories of products include consumer products, industrial products, and digital products and services (sometime referred to as “platforms”).  Product refers to a specific implementation of an object and should not be confused with an industry that includes the product; for example, Apple Watch (product) vs. Watch (industry).
