## Entity naming convention:

- When possible accelerator batch name should should follow the format of [`Accelerator`] [Batch Name].  For example, *Y Combinator W22 Batch.*
- Name should include the batch number, date, or season (when it exists) of the batch to disambiguate from other cohorts.  Ex. *Plug and Play Insurtech Batch 6* [not *Plug and Play Insurtech Batch* or *Plug and Play Insurtech*]
- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should match that of the name on the official website or other page, such as a blog or press release, controlled by the accelerator program.
- Name should be in English.  If the official name of the accelerator batch is in another language, it should be added to the `Official Name` field.
