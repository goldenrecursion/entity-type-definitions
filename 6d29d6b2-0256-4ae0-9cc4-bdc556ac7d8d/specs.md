## Entity naming convention:

- When possible, the acquisition name should follow the format: Acquisition of [`Acquired Company`] by [`Acquirer`].  Ex. *Acquisition of Postmates by Uber*
- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling of [`Acquired Company`] and [`Acquirer`] in the entity name should match with the name as it appears in the `Acquired Company` and `Acquirer` fields.
