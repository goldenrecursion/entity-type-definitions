An acquisition occurs when a company or investor purchases shares in another company for a majority or total level of ownership. Owning at least 50% of a company's stock makes that shareholder the main controller of the business.  Acquisitions should not be confused with mergers, which occur when two companies join forces to create a new legal entity. In an acquisition, the purchaser of the company is the new controller. Acquired companies often still stay active under the ownership of the new one while retaining their internal management structures.
