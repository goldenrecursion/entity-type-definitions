An investment fund, or venture capital fund, is a collective pool of capital coming from multiple internal or external investors.  Investment funds manage the money of the investors, and its investments are generally in high-growth opportunities in startups and other early-stage firms. An investment fund (such as Sequoia Capital U.S. Growth Partners Fund VIII, L.P.) should not be confused with the firm (such as Sequoia Capital) that manages it.
