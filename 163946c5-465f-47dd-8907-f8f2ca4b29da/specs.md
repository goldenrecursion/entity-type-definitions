## Entity naming convention:

- Name should be in English, except in the case of English language works with a full or partial non-English title.  Ex. *The 400 Blows*, not *Les Quatre Cents Coups. Chocolat (2000 film) not Chocolate (2000 film)*.
- If the official name of the creative work is in another language, it should be added to the `Official Name` field, and other widely used variations may be added to `Also Known As`.
- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should reflect the name as it appear on a source owned or controlled by the person or group who created it (such as the movie studio that produced a film title) or as it is commonly used by other reliable sources.
- Name should reflect a shortened name if that name is more commonly used.  Ex. *On the Origin of Species* not *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.*
- Creative medium format should be added in parentheses to disambiguate multiple creative works in a media franchise or otherwise with the same name.  The primary work can be named without disambiguation, and additional works with parentheses.  Ex. *Lord of the Rings (primary book), Lord of the Rings (film series), Lord of the Rings (board game).*
- Dates should be added in parentheses to disambiguate multiple creative works of the same type with the same name.  Ex. *Dune (2021 film)* and *Dune (1984 film)*.
