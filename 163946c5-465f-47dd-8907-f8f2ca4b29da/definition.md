A creative work is a manifestation or exemplification of a creative endeavor. Creative works come in many forms, such as writing (poetry, fiction and nonfiction, manuscripts and other literary forms), film and video, multimedia, music, painting, and the performing arts. The fictional characters that appear in creative works such as books, films, cartoons, and other forms are also creative works themselves and should be included here. A creative work should not be confused with the medium in which is produced or with the person or group who created the creative work. An individual person who is the creator of work is included in the Person entity type rather than Creative Work, and a group (such as a band or a theater group) is included in the Organization entity type instead of Creative Work.  A creative work may be a remake or reimagining of another creative work. A creative work is commonly used in the context of copyright.
