## Person
#### Definition: 

A person refers to a human being, whether an adult or child, who is considered to have certain capacities or attributes, which may include reason, morality, consciousness, or self-consciousness.  Person includes those living and deceased. Person does not include fictional characters.

#### Entity naming convention:

- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should match that of the current name on the person’s official website or other page controlled by the person.  In the absence of either, it should match what is commonly used by reliable sources.
- If the official or commonly used name include a first and last name, the name should be in the format: [First name] [Last name].  Ex. *Elon Musk*, not *Musk, Elon*.
- If the official or commonly used name include a first name or initial, middle name or initial, and last name, the name should be in the format: [First name or initial] [Middle name or initial] [Last name]. Ex. *George Bernard Shaw*, *F. Scott Fitzgerald*, *J. D. Salinger*.
- If the common use is a single word (usually in antiquity), that should be used for the title. Ex. *Aristotle*.
- The first letter of each word in Person names should be capitalized, unless the official name is lowercase or all caps.  Ex. *Barack Obama,* not *barack obama* and not *BARACK OBAMA.*
- If the person’s current name is not their birth name, the birth name may be included in the Birth Name field.  Ex. `Name`: *Lady Gaga.* `Birth Name`: *Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta.*
- Names that a person assumes for a particular purpose that are not their current name may be included in `Pseudonym`.  Other additional names for a person may be included in `Also Known As`.
- When the person’s name includes suffixes such as Jr., Sr., II, III, this abbreviation should be appended to the name with a space but no comma. Ex. *Martin Luther King Jr., Henry Ford II.*
- Honorifics, such as Mr., Mrs., Dr., Lord, President, should not be included as prefixes or otherwise in the name.  Ex. *Joe Biden*, not *President Joe Biden*.  Post-nominal honorifics may be added as suffixes if officially part of the person’s name, but generally are not included.
- If a person’s name is exactly the same as another and requires disambiguation, a one–three word descriptor for what they are known for may be added in parentheses after the name,. ie, “(actor)” or “(politician)”
- For names with different writing systems, such as Japanese or Korean names, the name should be romanized, and follow the formatting on a website or other resource owned or controlled by the person or, in absence of those, the formatting commonly used in trusted sources.  The non-romanized name may be added to `Official Name`.
