## Entity naming convention:

- Capitalization, spacing, punctuation, and other styling should match that of the name on the official website or other page controlled by the organization.
- Name should be the current name of the organization.  If the name has changed, past names should be added to `Previous Name`.
- Name should be in English.  If the official name is in another language, it should be added to the `Official Name` field, and other widely used variations may be added to `Also Known As`.
- An acronym should only be used as the name if it is the current official name of an organization.  Ex. *AARP, YMCA*.
- Articles (a, the) and punctuation (&) should be included if part of the organizationâ€™s official name.  Ex*. A Helping Hand, AT&T.*
- For names shared by multiple entities, add a brief 1-3 word industry, field, or location in parentheses for disambiguation.  Ex. *Roma (football club).*
